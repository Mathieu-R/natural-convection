The goal is to resolve a 3rd order non-linear ODE for the blasius problem.
It's made of 2 equations (flow / heat)

RK4 + Shooting Method

CHECK : testes with basic_blasius_edo and compared with Legat graph and it works.

if we have :

we can transform it into :
f'(t_0) = fprime_t0 ; f''(t_0) = a

we define the function F(a) = f'(infty ; a) - fprime_inf
if F(a) has a root in "a",
then the solutions to the initial value problem with f''(t_0) = a
is also the solution the boundary problem with f'(eta -> infty) = fprime_inf

our goal is to find the root, we have the root...we have the solution.
it can be done with bissection method or newton method.

NOTE :  we have two boundary values for the 2 coupled ODE.
        I guess we should manage these two in parallel.
